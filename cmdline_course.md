The course command line tools for linguists is a great introductory course for total beginners. We learn how to use the command line (Ubuntu for Windows users), editors, regex, scripting and so much more in 7 weeks. A more detailed description follows:


## Week 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

The first week did not include too many new things for me, as I had a little bit of experience with the command line because of taking Introduction to Language Technology as well as learning about it a little bit independently. The basic commands I had used already. I had installed Ubuntu for Windows prior to the course because I wanted to start following an online course in another institution but then decided I would rather do the one at my own university and specifically aimed at linguists.

## Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System

During the second week, I learned to compress files and use chmod properly. I also learned how to put up a remote connection to a server. I had practiced this a little bit before and without complete success with my Raspberry Pi, so I was really happy I finally learned how to do it.

## Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing

This was the first week that started requiring more from me, I had to read a lot about the encoding systems because I had almost completely forgotten what I had learned when taking Introduction to Computer Science. I learned to do dos2unix and print heads and tails of files and so on. Some of this was more like a refresher, because I had been taking a course on DataCamp that had these topics. Regex we had used in the Introduction to Language Technology course, but this time I felt like I actually knew what I was doing instead of just copying the instructions.

## Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing

I really loved the comic strip for the week, I really hope that happens one day. This was a bit of a challenging week for me, but I eventually managed to complete everything. I got a bit overwhelmed with sed, and almost quit, but after taking a little pause, it started working. I got really excited about what we can do with all the tools. I got more confident in my abilities to adapt instructions into something I wanted to do myself.

## Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files

Week 5 was a success for me, although I had a lot of painful moments and the Slack channel helped a lot. Scripting is so much fun and I came up with downloading a WhatsApp chat log and making a frequency list of it with one of my scripts. I also made a custom prompt with a cat emoji and a nice blue color.

## Week 6: Installing and Running Programs

This week was a challenge for me, I think I was not able to do all that was necessary in the exact correct way, but I kind of persisted and powered through despite challenges such as forgetting to submit my homework although I had done it in good time. I somehow remembered it when I woke up in the morning. I have been able to use apt-get and pip a lot after this whenever I have problems, but the Makefile parts were pretty difficult in the quiz. I will not be discouraged though, because this has made me notice a clear area for improvement and I can focus on this after the course.

## Week 7: Version Control

The final week was an interesting one, because we got to create a GitHub profile and finally learn how to do proper version control. I had a lot of trouble at first and needed to Google a lot in addition to watching the videos, but I started to get the hang of it. 

## Final Assignment: Building Webpages using GitHub Pages

The final assignment was a chance for me to combine most of what I have learned during the course and also show to myself and hopefully also to my teachers that I am able to modify and create things by myself and solve problems. I had a lot of difficulties cloning the templates, with bundle install more specifically, but I followed the error messages, used apt-get, a lot of sudo, reopened terminals and used Stack Overflow and the Slack channel for additional support. I am very proud of myself!

My name is Venla and this is my final assignment for the command line course I am taking in the fall term of 2019. I am majoring in language technology and my background is in translation studies, so I have a lot to catch up with in terms of technical knowledge. In addition to studying, I enjoy reading extensively and excessively and playing video games.
